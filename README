📊 E-Commerce Data Engineering Pipeline
🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-style end-to-end batch ETL data engineering pipeline built to process and analyze large-scale e-commerce sales data.

It simulates a real-world analytics workflow used in retail and marketplace businesses.




The pipeline:

Extracts raw CSV sales data

Cleans and standardizes data using business rules

Performs data quality validation

Loads transformed data into a MySQL data warehouse

Visualizes KPIs using an interactive Streamlit dashboard

The system processes 68,000+ sales records and produces business-level insights including revenue trends, fulfillment performance, and order lifecycle distribution.

🔧 Key Features
✅ Modular ETL Design

Separate extract, transform, and load components for maintainability and scalability.

✅ Data Quality Checks

Duplicate removal

Null handling

Negative revenue filtering

Date validation

✅ Business Status Normalization

Raw order statuses are standardized into:

Delivered

In Transit

Cancelled

Returned

Pending

This enables clean business-level analytics.

✅ Incremental Loading

Implements:

ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE


Ensures:

No duplicate inserts

Idempotent pipeline runs

Safe reprocessing

✅ Optimized MySQL Performance

Primary key indexing on order_id

Aggregation-ready schema

✅ Interactive Dashboard KPIs

💰 Total Revenue

📦 Total Orders

🏢 B2B Orders

❌ Cancellation Rate

🛒 Average Order Value (AOV)

🚚 Fulfillment Revenue Split

📍 Revenue by State

📈 Monthly Revenue Trend

📦 Order Lifecycle Distribution

🗄 Database Schema
Table: sales_data
Column	Description
order_id	Primary Key
order_date	Order date
amount	Revenue per record
business_status	Normalized order lifecycle
ship_state	Shipping state
fulfilment	Amazon / Merchant
b2b	B2B flag
📂 Dataset

The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints.

You can download it from Kaggle:

Setup Instructions

Download the dataset from Kaggle.

Rename the file to:

raw_sales.csv


Place it inside the Data/ folder:

Data/raw_sales.csv

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Set Environment Variable (Windows)
set DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password


(Mac/Linux)

export DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password

3️⃣ Run ETL Pipeline
cd etl
python run_pipeline.py

4️⃣ Start Dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py


Then open:

http://localhost:8501

📊 Business Insights Generated

From the dataset:

~14% cancellation rate

~1.7% return rate

Strong revenue concentration across specific states

Significant revenue split between Amazon and Merchant fulfillment

Clear order lifecycle segmentation (In Transit, Delivered, Returned, etc.)
